    //  The when expression is similar to the switch statement in Java.
    //
    //This is how it works:
    //
    //The when variable (day) is evaluated once
    //The value of the day variable is compared with the values of each "branch"
    //Each branch starts with a value, followed by an arrow (->) and a result
    //If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
    //else is used to specify some code to run if there is no match
    //In the example above, the value of day is 4, meaning "Thursday" will be print
