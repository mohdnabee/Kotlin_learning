package Function

//  Kotlin Functions
// A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
//
//You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
//
//Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as methods.
//
//Predefined Functions
//So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time through this tutorial!
//
//For example, println() is a function. It is used to output/print text to the screen:
//

 //  Create Your Own Functions
//  To create your own function, use the fun keyword, and write the name of the function, followed by parantheses ():
//
//Example
//Create a function named "myFunction" that should output some text:

fun  myFunction(){
    println("I just go executed !")
}

//  call a function
//  Now that you have created a function, you can execute it by calling it.
//
//To call a function in Kotlin, write the name of the function followed by two parantheses ().
//
//In the following example, myFunction() will print some text (the action), when it is called:

//  example
fun  main (){
    myFunction() //  call function
}
